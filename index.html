                    <p>Hi, I am Nguyen Le passionate in a career as a Full Stack Web Developer to further enhance and demonstrate my abilities to build frontend and backend technologies. 
                    What first introduced me to code is my drive to build my very own website from scratch. 
                    It started by learning through basic online tutorials and videos on HTML, CSS, and Javascript where I then decided I wanted to learn both frontend and backend coding languages. 
                    I have completed several projects on Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer course and currently attend a coding bootcamp at UC Davis Extension to build on my skills and gain more experience and knowledge as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

                    <p>My interests include fitness, art, adventures, technology, sports, food, music, and exploring and learning new things.</p>
